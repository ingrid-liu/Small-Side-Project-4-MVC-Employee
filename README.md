This project is a perfect practice to dive into full-stack application as a junior developer. 
It covers:
- Build your own API along with an Angular application that uses and consumes the API.
- Use Spring Boot framework and MySQL database to implement Spring Data JPA.
- Create a spring boot API, expose API Endpoints Over HTTP, and handle HTTP Requests through API Endpoints. 
- Test API Endpoints by using an HTTP client and the browser DevTools.
- Practice the basic concepts of Angular components, Angular Forms, Angular Routing, and Angular Services. 
- Implement Angular HTTP Communication.
