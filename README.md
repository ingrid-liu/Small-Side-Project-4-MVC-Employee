This project is a perfect practice to dive into full-stack application as a junior developer. 
It covers:
- Build your own API along with an Angular application that uses and consumes the API.
- Use Spring Boot framework and MySQL database to implement Spring Data JPA.
- Create a spring boot API, expose API Endpoints Over HTTP, and handle HTTP Requests through API Endpoints. 
- Test API Endpoints by using an HTTP client and the browser DevTools.
- Practice the basic concepts of Angular components, Angular Forms, Angular Routing, and Angular Services. 
- Implement Angular HTTP Communication.

If you are not familiar with database or Spring Data JPA, I highly recommend you to learn this 1.5hr tutorial before you start this small project.

Here is the pre-knowledge tutorial link:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SGDpanrc8U&t=2759s&ab_channel=Amigoscode<br>
You will learn how to set up a database (PostgreSQL) and how to deploy JPA through Spring framework in the tutorial.

Here is the tutorial for this project (2.5hr): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx4iBLKLVHk&ab_channel=Amigoscode
I use JDK 16 & Spring boot2.6.0 for my own project, which is slightly different from the tutorial. 
And there are several tiny modifications on the TS syntax. Feel free to check my code while you are playing around.
